The idea of StakingLink aims at solving one of the biggest problems blockchain has which is the inability to work together cross-chain. StakingLink will provide a bridge hub that allows users to promote the use of Algorand Standard Assets with all other independent blockchains to improve more liquidity on Algorand blockchain, enable fast token transfer, lower gas fee and DeFi staking finance products.

StakingLink is a DeFi platform that:
1.	Provides investment opportunities to earn passive income by staking Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) into specifically defined ASA smart contracts.   
2.	Allowing users to swap Top 20 market capitalization (expand more in future releases) tokens swap into Algo ASAs and vice versa via our purposely-built cross-chain connector to improve on trading activities on Algorand network and market shares.
3.	Incentives such as free gas fee, free StakingLink bonus tokens, high staking Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for ASAs will be provided to swap into Algo ASAs as opposed to other assets to promote buying demand into ASAs which can help on further improving ASAs liquidity and market shares. 

We believe by leveraging the Algorand platformâ€™s technologies which have successfully solved the Blockchain Trilemma, the StakingLink platform can further enhance the frictionless transactions and increase liquidity for the Algorand ecosystem.

StakingLink will be freely available via a website portal allowing anyone across the world to use. StakingLink webapp will support both desk and mobile browsers allowing access through mobile devices and desktop computer.
